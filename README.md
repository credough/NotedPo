NotedPo  

NotedPo is my very first fully deployed solo project — a simple yet functional note-taking / journaling web application.  
This project was a big milestone for me as it’s the first time I’ve successfully deployed both the frontend and backend. 
The sole purpose of this project is to test myself if I can do simple full working web application solo.
