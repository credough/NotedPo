**NotedPo** is my very first fully deployed solo project. A simple yet functional note-taking / journaling web application.  

This project was a big step for me as it’s the first time that I’ve successfully deployed both frontend and backend only by solo. 
The sole purpose of this project is to test myself if I can do simple full working web application.
